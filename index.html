        Hello there. If you're reading the source code... man, you must be _really_ bored, huh?
        Anyway, how's it going? I can't wait for the academic year to be over and to finally graduate.
        I hope you're doing fine too. I think we did a pretty good job with the Atelier.

        If you did see this, then let one of us know! Especially Nithesh, the person who wrote this (not so secret)
        message to you right now.
